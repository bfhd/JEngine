<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The request modification of service/resource is triggered on the placer application to request that information pertaining to an existing service or resource be changed for an existing appointment.  Services and resources are represented by the AIS, AIG, AIL, and AIP segments on an HL7 scheduling interface transaction.  This trigger event should only be used for appointments that have not been completed, or for parent appointments whose children have not been completed.  If it is successful, an application acknowledgment is returned, optionally containing an SCH segment and related detail segments describing the modified appointment.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This trigger event should not be used when an existing resource or service must be replaced or rescheduled for an existing appointment.  The following fields on the indicated segments should not be changed by this trigger event: the first three fields of the AIS, the first four fields of the AIG, the first four fields of the AIL, and the first four fields of the AIP.  Instead, use two trigger events to accomplish the replacement or rescheduling of a service or resource:  S09 (request cancellation of service/resource), as well as S07 (request addition of service/resource).  </FONT>
