<P>The basic level of definition within HL7 is that of the abstract message associated with a particular trigger event.  The abstract message definition includes the data fields that will be sent within a message, the valid response messages, and the treatment of application level errors or the failure of the underlying communications system.  An HL7 abstract message is defined in terms of HL7 segments and fields, as described in Section 2.4.8.</TD>

<P>American College of Radiology and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association.  The American College of Radiology formed a relationship with the National Electronic Manufacturers&#146; Association in 1982 to develop a standard for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM).  The purpose of the standard was to promote a generic digital image communication format; facilitate the development and expansion of picturing archiving and communication systems (PACS); allow the creation of diagnostic information databases for remote access; and help assure the useability of new equipment with existing systems.  The current standard (Version 3.0) defines image data as well as patient, study and visit information necessary to provide the context for the images.  Approval of this document as an American National Standard may be pursued in the future by NEMA, which is accredited by ANSI.</TD>

<P>Pre-marketing: An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator&#146;s Brochure for an unapproved investigational product). 
<P>Post-marketing/US (current): Unexpected means an adverse drug experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the drug product and includes an event that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling but differs from the event because of greater severity or specificity. 
<P>Post-marketing/US (proposed): The applicant&#146;s core safety data sheet shall be a document prepared by the applicant that contains all relevant safety information, including adverse drug experiences, which the applicant believes should e listed for the drug in all countries where the drug is marketed.  It may be used by the applicant as the reference document by which an adverse drug experience is judged to be expected or unexpected for purposes of this post-marketing periodic report. 
<P>Post-marketing/European Union: This relates to an adverse reaction which is not mentioned in any ECsummary of product characteristics (SPC).  In the absence of any European SPC, an international document prepared by the marketing authorization holder containing all relevant safety information which the marketing authorization holder considers should be listed for the medicinal product in all countries where the medicinal product is marketed (Care Data Sheet). 
<P>Post-marketing/WHO: An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with domestic labeling or market authorization, or expected from characteristics of the drug.</TD>

<P><B>Subcomponent Separator</B>
</TD><TD WIDTH=432 VALIGN=top >
<P>The subcomponent separator is used to separate adjacent subcomponents of some data fields.  Its use is described in the descriptions of the relevant data fields.  The character that represents the subcomponent separator is specified for each message as the fourth character in the Encoding Characters data field of the MSH segment.  Absent other considerations it is recommended that all sending applications use &quot;&amp;&quot; as the subcomponent separator.   However, all applications are required to accept whatever character is included in the Message Header and use it to parse the message.</TD>

<P><B>Trigger Event</B>
</FONT>
</TD><TD WIDTH=432 VALIGN=top >
<P>The event that initiates an exchange of messages is called a trigger event.  The HL7 Standard is written from the assumption that an event in the real world of health care creates the need for data to flow among systems.  The real-world event is called the trigger event.  For example, the trigger event &quot;a patient is admitted&quot; may cause the need for data about that patient to be sent to a number of other systems.  There is a one-to-many relationship between message types and trigger event codes.  The same trigger event code may not be associated with more than one message type.</TD>
