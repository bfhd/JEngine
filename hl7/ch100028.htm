<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A placer application uses this trigger event to request that an existing appointment be rescheduled.  The new Requested Start Date and Time, Appointment Duration, Repeating Interval, Repeating Interval Duration, and/or Priority are provided in the ARQ segment, along with the existing placer and filler identification numbers.  If it is successful, an application acknowledgment is returned, optionally containing an SCH segment and related detail segments describing the new information for the rescheduled appointment.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This transaction should not be used to reschedule an appointment that has begun but has not been completed.  In such cases, and only if it is logical to do so, the appointment should be discontinued and a new schedule request should be submitted.  Likewise, this transaction should not be used to reschedule a parent appointment, in which one or more children have begun or have already occurred.  Again, the parent appointment should be discontinued, and a new schedule request should be made.  This procedure removes any ambiguity between applications that may arise with an attempt to modify an appointment that is in progress.</FONT>
