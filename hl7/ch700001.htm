<P>This chapter describes the transaction set required for sending structured patient oriented clinical data from one computer system to another.  A common use of these transaction sets will be to transmit observations and results of diagnostic studies from the producing system (e.g., clinical laboratory system, EKG system) (the filler), to the ordering system (e.g., HIS order entry, physician&#146;s office system) (the placer).  However, the transaction set is not limited to such transactions.  Observations can be sent from producing systems to archival medical record systems (not necessarily the order placer) and from such medical record systems to other systems that were not part of the ordering loop, e.g., an office practice system of the referring physician for inpatient test results ordered by an inpatient surgeon.  This chapter also provides mechanisms for registering clinical trials and methods for linking orders and results to clinical trials and for reporting experiences with drugs and devices.
<P>These transaction sets permit the transmission of any kind of clinical observations including (but not limited to) clinical laboratory results, the results of imaging studies (excluding the image), EKG pulmonary function studies, measures of patient status and condition, vital signs, Intake and output, severity and/or frequency of symptoms, drug allergies, problem lists, diagnostic lists, physician and nursing history, physicals, progress notes, operative notes and so on.  These transaction sets carry information that is reported as text, numeric or categorical values.  These messages do not carry the images themselves. (See ACR NEMA Publication 300-1988<I> Digital Imaging and Communications </I><I>Standard</I>, for image standards, and ASTM E1467.91 <I>Standard specification for transferring digital </I><I>neurophysiological data between independent computer systems</I>, for transmitting EEG, EMG tracings).
<P>An observation can be one of many data types.  The main ones are text, numbers and codes.  This provides the flexibility needed to transmit observations that are recorded as continuous values (e.g., glucose, diastolic blood pressure), as categorical values, e.g., patient position (sitting, reclining or standing), VDRL (reactive, weakly reactive or nonreactive), or as text. An entire History and Physical could be transmitted as an observation whose value is one large chunk of formatted text.
<P>This chapter provides mechanisms for transmitting <I>structured</I>, record-oriented reports.  This means that individual observations are transmitted as separate logical entities (objects), and within this entity, separate fields are defined for identifying the observation, its values, its units, normal ranges, etc., such that the receiving system can &quot;understand&quot;, reorganize and/or react to the contents of these messages.  Structured reports are to be distinguished from text oriented reports which can also be transmitted via HL7 using the UDM message described in Chapter 2.  The latter are ASCII images of nonstandard printed reports intended for display to humans.  For practical purposes their contents are not understandable to the computer. 
<P>Observations may be transmitted in a solicited (in response to a query) or unsolicited mode.  In the solicited mode, a user requests a set of observations according to criteria transmitted by the user. The sending system responds with existing data to satisfy the query (subject to access controls).  Queries do not elicit new observations by the target system, they simply retrieve old observations.  (See Chapter 2 for full discussion of the query transmission.)
<P>The unsolicited mode is used primarily to transmit the values of new observations. It is the mode used by producing services to return the values of observations requested by an ordering system.  A laboratory system, for example, would usually send the results of an AM electrolytes to the ordering HIS via the unsolicited mode.  An intensive care system would send the blood pressures to the same HIS by the same mode.  Calling such transactions unsolicited may sound like a misnomer, but is not.  The placing service solicits the producing service to make the observation.  It could also (through a query) solicit the value of that observation after it has been made.  However, such an approach would demand continuous polling of the producing system until the result was produced.  Using the unsolicited mode, the producing service returns the value of an observation as soon as it is available.  The unsolicited mode can also be used to transmit new results to a system (e.g. an archival medical record system) that did not order the observation.  The transactions that define these modes are more fully described in Section <A HREF="ch700006.htm#I9">7.2</A>, &quot;<A HREF="ch700006.htm#I13">MESSAGE DEFINITIONS</A>.&quot;
<P>Observations are usually ordered and reported as sets (batteries) of many separate observations. Physicians order electrolytes (consisting of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate) or vitals (consisting of diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, pulse, and temperature).  Moreover, tests that we may think of as single entity, e.g., cardiac echo, usually yield multiple separate measurements, e.g. left ventricular diameter, left atrial diameter, etc.  Moreover, observations that are usually reported as text (e.g. the review of systems from the history and physical) can also be considered a set of separately analyzable units (e.g. cardiac history, pulmonary history, genito-urinary history, etc.).  We strongly suggest that all text clinical reports be broken down into such separate analyzable entities and that these individual entities be transmitted as separate OBX segments.  Because many attributes of a set of observations taken at one time will be identical, one OBR segment serves as a header for the report and carries the information that applies to all of the individual observations in the set.  In the case of ordered observations, the OBR segment is a &quot;turn-around document&quot; like the manual request forms it replaces.  It carries information about the order to the producing service; a copy of the OBR with additional fields completed is returned with the observations to the requesting service.
<P>Not all observations are preceded by an order.  However, all observations whether explicitly ordered or initiated without an order are reported with an OBR segment as the report header.
<P>The major segments (OBR, OBX) defined in this chapter, their fields, and the code tables have been defined in collaboration with ASTM E31.11 with the goal of keeping HL7 observation transmission the same as ASTM E1238 in pursuit of the goals of ANSI HISPP and the Message Standards Developers Subcommittee (Some sections of this chapter have been taken with permission directly from the E1238-91 document and vice versa in pursuit of those goals).
<P>The OBR segment provides information that applies to all of the observations that follow.  It includes a field that identifies a particular battery (or panel or set) of observations (e.g., electrolytes, vital signs or Admission H&amp;P).  For simplicity we will refer to the observation set as the battery.  The battery usually corresponds to the entity that is ordered or performed as a unit.  (In the case of a query, observation sets may be a more arbitrary collection of observations.)  The OBX segment provides information about a single observation, and it includes a field that identifies that single observation (e.g., potassium, diastolic blood pressure or admission diagnosis).  Both of these fields assume master tables that define coding systems (the universe of valid identifying codes) for batteries and observations, respectively.  These tables will usually be part of the producing and sending services application and (usually) include many other useful pieces of information about the observation or battery.  Segments for transmitting such master file information between systems that produce and systems that use clinical information are described in Chapter 8. 
<P>This standard does not require the use of a particular coding system to identify either batteries or single observations  In the past, local institutions tended to invent their own unique code systems for identifying test and other clinical observations because standard codes were not available.  Such local code systems sufficed for transmitting information within the institutions but presented high barriers to pooling data from many sources for research or for building medical record systems. However, standard code systems such as LOINC and SNOMED now exist for many of these purposes, and we strongly encourage their use in observation reporting. These codes can be sent either as the only code or they can be sent along with the local historic code as the second code system in a CE code.  
<P>In past versions of the HL7 standard, Appendix A to Chapter 7 presented suggestions for constructing clinical codes from existing procedure code systems such as CPT4.  Appendix A is now part of the Implementation Guide and contains LOINC codes for most laboratory tests and many common clinical variables (e.g., vital signs, intake and output, cardiovascular measurements and others).  The most recent version of the LOINC data base, which includes records for more than 7,000 observations and includes codes, names, synonyms and other attributes (such as the molecular weights of chemical moieties) for each observation, is available from the HL7 file server at <a href="http://dumccss.mc.duke.edu/standards/termcode/loinclab/loinc.html">http://dumccss.mc.duke.edu/standards/termcode/loinclab/loinc.html</a>.  The implementation guide provides construction rules for  many variables that are not yet covered by LOINC. Codes for  Neurophysiologic variables (EEG, EMG, Evoked potentials) are provided in Appendix X2 of ASTM E1467. 
<P>Some parts of this document (the discussion and tables defining units, the discussion of the rules of mapping observations to OBX segments, and some of the examples at the end of the chapter have been copied (with permission) from ASTM E1238. 
<P>As is true throughout this standard, the emphasis should be on the abstract messages, defined without regard to the encoding rules.  The example messages, however, are based upon the HL7 encoding rules.
