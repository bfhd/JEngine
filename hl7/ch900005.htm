<P>Each triggering event is listed below, along with the applicable form of the message exchange. The notation used to describe the sequence, optionality, and repetition of segments is described in Chapter 2, &quot;Format for Defining Abstract Messages.&quot;  There are two classes of events, those which contain notifications only, and those which contain both notifications and content (text contained in OBX segments).  
<P>These triggering events are mainly associated with documents or entries that will be or have been transcribed. The types and appearance of the transcribed documents can vary greatly within a healthcare organization and between organizations.  However, the main purpose of the transcription process is to document patient care or diagnostic results in a legible manner; these documents then become part of the legal medical record.  The conceptual purpose of document notification is to facilitate updating the receiving system(s) with information from the source system(s), typically  dictation or transcription systems, to indicate that an electronic document has been created or altered. The document notification message can be attached to an entire document (i.e., transcribed document) or can be transmitted stand-alone.  In either case, the document notification is transmitted in the form of an unsolicited update or in response to a record-oriented query.  A document notification message can be created under a variety of circumstances such as when: 1) dictation has been completed; 2) a document has been transcribed; or 3) the status of a document has been changed, for example, when a document has been authenticated.
