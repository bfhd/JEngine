In the US, most generic drug names are assigned by the US Adopted Name Council (USAN). Other generic names in common use are the National Formulary (NF) and the US Pharmacopoeia (USP) names.  <I>Figure 7-3</I> lists other available drug coding systems.

<P>7.9.1.6   <B> adverse event/adverse experience</B>:

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#149; Post-marketing/European Union: Any undesirable experience occurring to a patient treated with a pharmaceutical product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#149; Post-marketing/US: Any adverse event associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, including the following: An adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a drug product in professional practice; an adverse event occurring from drug overdose; an adverse event occurring from drug withdrawal; and any failure of expected pharmacologic action.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#149; WHO: Any untoward medical occurrence that may present during treatment with a pharmaceutical product but which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this product.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#149; Post-marketing/WHO: A response to a drug which is noxious and unintended, and which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease or for the modification of physiologic function</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#149; Post-marketing/European Union: A reaction which is harmful and unintended and which occurs at doses normally used in man for the prophylaxis, diagnosis, or treatment of disease or the modification of physiological function.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#149; Post-marketing/US: Any undesirable effect reasonably associated with the use of the drug, that may occur as part of the pharmacological action of the drug or may be unpredictable.</FONT>
<P>7.9.1 8    <B>causation</B>:  an exposure which truly does increase or decrease the probability of a certain outcome.
<P>7.9.1.9    <B>causal relationship</B>:  when an event occurs a product may be suspected as causing the event but rarely can it be proven particularly at an early stage of the product&#146;s life.  Certain information about the relationship between the product and the event can reinforce the believe in a causal relationship between the product and the event while others can decrease the probability that there is a causal relationship.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  These should also be considered serious.</FONT>
<P>7.9.1.14  <B>E</B><B>xpected adverse product reaction:</B>  expected events are those which prior experience has demonstrated to be probabilistically linked to the product and are generally included in product labeling.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Post-marketing/European Union: This relates to an adverse reaction which is not mentioned in any ECsummary of product characteristics (SPC).  In the absence of any European SPC, an international document prepared by the marketing authorization holder containing all relevant safety information which the marketing authorization holder considers should be listed for the medicinal product in all countries where the medicinal product is marketed (Care Data Sheet).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Post-marketing/US current: Unexpected means an adverse drug experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the drug product and includes an event that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling but differs from the event because of greater severity or specificity.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Post-marketing/US (proposed): The applicant&#146;s core safety data sheet shall be a document prepared by the applicant that contains all relevant safety information, including adverse drug experiences, which the applicant believes should e listed for the drug in all countries where the drug is marketed.  It may be used by the applicant as the reference document by which an adverse drug experience is judged to be expected or unexpected for purposes of this post-marketing periodic report.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Post-marketing/WHO: An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with domestic labeling or market authorization, or expected from characteristics of the drug.</FONT>
