<P>The term &quot;Level 7&quot; refers to the highest level of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model of the International Standards Organization (ISO).  This is not to say that HL7 conforms to ISO defined elements of the OSI&#146;s seventh level.  Also, HL7 does not specify a set of ISO approved specifications to occupy layers 1 to 6 under HL7&#146;s abstract message specifications.  HL7 does, however, correspond to the conceptual definition of an application-to- application interface placed in the seventh layer of the OSI model.
<P>In the OSI conceptual model, the functions of both communications software and hardware are separated into seven layers, or levels.  The HL7 Standard is primarily focused on the issues that occur within the seventh, or application, level.  These are the definitions of the data to be exchanged, the timing of the exchanges, and the communication of certain application specific errors between the applications.  However, of necessity, protocols that refer to the lower layers of the OSI model are sometimes mentioned to help implementors understand the context of the Standard.  They are also sometimes specified to assist implementors in establishing working HL7-based systems.
<P>The HL7 Working Group is composed of volunteers who give their time on a personal basis or under sponsorship of their employers.  Membership in the HL7 Working Group has been, and continues to be, open to anyone wishing to contribute to the development and refinement of  Level 7 Interface Standard for network technology in healthcare.
<P>The Standard currently addresses the interfaces among various systems that send or receive patient admissions/registration, discharge or transfer (ADT) data, queries, resource and patient scheduling, orders, results, clinical observations, billing, master file update information, medical records, scheduling, patient referral, and patient care.  <B>It does not try to assume a particular architecture with respect to the placement of data within </B><B>applications but is designed to support a central patient care system as well as a more distributed environment </B><B>where data resides in departmental systems.</B>
<P>If we consider the multitude of healthcare information systems applications as well as the variety of environments in which healthcare is delivered, it is evident that there are many more interfaces which could benefit from standardization.  The interfaces chosen were considered to be of high priority by the members participating in the standards writing process.  HL7&#146;s intent is to prepare a complete standard for these interfaces, built on a generic framework that is sufficiently robust to support many other interfaces.  This Standard has been put into production and is being used as a basis for extending the existing interface definitions and also adding other definitions.
<P>It is expected that one result of publishing this specification will be the recruitment of more Working Group members with special interest in some newer and not yet fully specified areas.  Some of the areas that have already been identified are:
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">a) decision support</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">b) additional specific ancillary departments</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">c) information needs associated with healthcare delivery systems outside of the acute care setting</FONT>
<P>The above notwithstanding, the Working Group members feel that the interfaces addressed here are sufficient to provide significant benefit to the healthcare community.
<P>This document is structured as follows.  The balance of this chapter contains a rationale for developing the Standard, the goals of the Standard, and issues which have been considered by the Working Group pertaining to scope and operational approach.  It is hoped that this will help the readers understand the basis for decisions that have been made in developing the Standard.  Subsequent chapters specify, respectively:
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">a) the overall structure for all interfaces including a generalized query interface</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">b) patient admission, discharge, transfer and registration</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">c) order entry</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">d) patient accounting (billing) systems</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">e) clinical observation data, such as laboratory results, that are sent as identifiable data elements (rather than display oriented text)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">f) a generalized interface for synchronizing common reference files (master files)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">g) medical information management</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">h) patient and resource scheduling</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">i) patient referral messages for referring a patient between two institutions</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">j) patient care messages that support communication of problem-oriented records, and to provide functionality for the implementation of clinical pathways in computer information systems</FONT>
